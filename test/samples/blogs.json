            "post_content": "<p>When you decide to become a mentor for a law student you are making a very wise decision for both yourself and the law student. I have had the pleasure of acting as a mentor for Chapman law students for the past several years.</p>\n<p>While law schools do their best to train their students as to the \u201creal world\u201d of what it is like to work in a law firm, their emphasis is on teaching students the law. And while practical skills classes and clinical courses help students, after they pass the bar exam they are entering a world that is very foreign to them and they no longer have the guidance of a law professor.</p>\n<p>When law students become young lawyers they are most often not ready to begin their legal career. However, if they have the benefit of being mentored by an experienced lawyer they receive the benefit of learning from the ground up what it is like to practice law. When I work with a \u201cmentee\u201d I start by showing the mentee how you meet with and convince a client to retain your services.</p>\n<p>We then explain about retainer agreements, quoting fees to clients, etc.\u00a0 We also discuss the importance of truly caring about your clients. Most importantly, we talk about keeping regular contact with your client by phone and email.</p>\n<p>This type of insider information is only possible through a mentorship program.</p>\n<p>In addition, we have our mentees go to court with our lawyers so they learn what court is all about and how to handle court hearings before a judge. The students have also had the opportunity to watch court hearings when our associates appear in court on our cases. By the time the mentor-mentee relationship ends many of our mentees continue to stay involved with our law firm in different ways. Some will become law clerks for us. Some will write blogs or content for our websites. All of our mentees keep in touch when they have questions.</p>\n<p>I am constantly amazed at the level of professionalism shown by each Chapman law student whom I have mentored. The students are excited about learning about criminal defense and family law in the \u201creal world\u201d. These students have been able to listen to new client calls and sit in on new client consultations. These cases range from those accused of serious felonies to traffic infractions.</p>\n<p>So what is the benefit to the mentor by doing all of this? The benefit is that you get an opportunity to \u201cgive back\u201d by helping law students become prepared to be lawyers. You are doing the public a favor because members of the public will have the good fortune in the future of hiring these young lawyers. The future lawyers that you helped train will be ready to do a good job for their clients.</p>\n<p>It really makes you feel good to help a law student. You are doing the law student a favor. You are doing the law school where they are attending a favor. You are doing society a favor and more importantly you are doing yourself a favor.</p>\n<p>I strongly encourage any law student at Chapman to take the opportunity to get involved in the mentor-mentee program that your law school offers. While law schools do their best to train their students to become lawyers, it is the actual seeing how a law office runs and going to court that makes the law school education process much more complete.</p>\n<hr />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.chapman.edu/law/files/2013/10/PaulHeadshot.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6262\"><img src=\"http://blogs.chapman.edu/law/files/2013/10/PaulHeadshot.jpg\" alt=\"PaulHeadshot\" width=\"100\" height=\"140\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6262\" /></a>Paul Wallin is a founding partner of the <a href=\"http://www.wklaw.com/\">Wallin and Klarich Law firm</a> that covers criminal and family law cases throughout southern California.

Evan then politely responded that he was calculating the probability, based on past years, of college football players being on a college all-star game watch list, and after having gone through training camp and the NFL Draft, actually making an NFL team (while studying, of course). When asked \u201cWhy?\u201d he smiled again and answered, \u201cI want to ensure that the all-star game that I am looking at is a good indicator of NFL talent-to be, as opposed to a list of the other several thousand whom had the aspirations, but not the transferable talent from college to the pros.\u201d</p>\n<p>In laymen\u2019s terms, this means Evan is on the prowl for his next client. While attending Chapman\u2019s Fowler School of Law, Evan became one of the very few law students in the country to pass the National Football League (NFL) Agent Exam. He is, without a doubt, a go-getter who possesses a rare combination of street smarts and book smarts. His success can be attributed to years of hard work, research and networking.</p>\n<p>After graduating from BYU with a bachelor\u2019s degree in history, Evan faced the difficult decision many college graduates must make: he needed to quickly find a direction in which to take his career. He took into account earning potential, the skills at his disposal, and passion. This process led him to his \u201c<i>Jerry Maguire</i> moment\u201d and to his decision to pursue becoming a sports agent.</p>\n<p>Evan found he had the most connections and interest in football over other sports. \u201cMy playing days were over, but I wanted to do anything to be involved with that sport,\u201d he said. Armed with his interest and connections, he decided to earn his master\u2019s in Sports Management at California State University, Long Beach; he also completed an award-winning capstone research project in which he devised a business plan for a sports agency. Conducting interviews with CPAs, agents, players, and individuals in finance for this project helped Evan lay the foundation for establishing his own agency one day.</p>\n<p>Now that Evan has passed the Agent exam, he plans to execute the business plan he created while earning his master\u2019s degree. \u201cI&#8217;ve been fortunate that I&#8217;ve been around and seen so many others&#8217; successes and failures, that I have a good idea of what to do andwhat not to do,\u201d he said. He also intends to practice law in order to better serve his future athlete clients and hopes to find a law firm that will recognize the value of hiring a sports agent. &#8220;My future athlete clients will benefit from\u00a0a real legal practitioner, rather than a guy with a J.D. who does not actually practice law.&#8221; In an effort to get a head start on his legal resume, Evan has recently accepted a law clerk position at a law firm that specializes in personal injury. In an ideal world, Evan will not only work with athletes after he graduates, but he will also work in a law firm while exercising his skills in copyright, trademark, tax, business litigation and transactional matters that are commonplace for sports agents.</p>\n<p>Until that time comes, Evan is taking advantage of every possible learning opportunity in sports law that Chapman has to offer. He is involved in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ChapmanESLS\" target=\"_blank\">Chapman\u2019s Entertainment and Sports Law Society</a> and he is currently taking Professor Leigh Steinberg\u2019s<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/leighsteinberg/2013/08/21/novel-approach-to-sports-law-starts-at-chapman-law-school-today/\" target=\"_blank\"> sports law class</a>. Steinberg is a sports agent and a lawyer who happens to be the real-life inspiration for the movie <i>Jerry McGuire</i>. Evan is also in IP Law Society and just joined the Alternative Dispute Resolution team, where he will get ample opportunities to improve his negotiation skills.</p>\n<p>Evan offers this valuable advice for others looking to become sports agents in any capacity: \u201cBecoming an agent is not as difficult as remaining an agent. I would strongly caution those that think of doing this to have a very well thought out business plan that has been crosschecked and evaluated by those in the business.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
